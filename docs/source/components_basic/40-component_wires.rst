Jumper Wires
=====================

Wires that connect two terminals are called jumper wires. There are various kinds of jumper wires. Here we focus on jumper wires used in breadboards. They are primarily used to transfer electrical signals from anywhere on the breadboard to the input/output pins of a microcontroller.

Jumper wires are fitted by inserting their "end connectors" into the slots on the breadboard. Beneath the surface of the breadboard, parallel plates connect the slots in rows or columns. The "end connectors" are inserted into the specific slots required for the prototype without soldering.

There are three types of jumper wires: Female-to-Female, Male-to-Male, and Male-to-Female. Male-to-Female wires have a protruding pin on one end and a recessed socket on the other. Male-to-Male wires have pins on both ends, while Female-to-Female wires have sockets on both ends.

Multiple types of jumper wires can be used in a single project. The color of jumper wires varies to help identify the connections between different parts of the circuit, but the colors themselves do not indicate different functions. However, it is common practice to use red wires for positive power connections and black wires for negative power or ground connections.
