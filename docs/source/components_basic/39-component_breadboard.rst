Breadboard
==============

A breadboard is a construction base for prototyping of electronics. Originally the word referred to a literal bread board, a polished piece of wood used for slicing bread. In the 1970s the solderless breadboard (a.k.a. plugboard, a terminal array board) became available and nowadays the term "breadboard" is commonly used to refer to these.

It is used to build and test circuits quickly before finishing any circuit design. 
And it has many holes into which components mentioned above can be inserted like ICs and resistors as well as jumper wires. 
The breadboard allows you to plug in and remove components easily.

The picture shows the internal structure of a breadboard. Although the holes on the breadboard appear to be independent, they are actually connected internally by metal strips.

Inside the breadboard, hidden behind its plastic surface, are rows of metal strips. Each strip has small metal clips with teeth that grip the legs of the components. These clips ensure a secure electrical connection between components inserted into the same row. The power rails on the sides have longer strips to provide connections for power supply.

Most breadboards have numbers, letters, and plus and minus signs on them. These labels help you find the corresponding holes quickly when building your circuit. The row numbers and column letters help you precisely locate the holes on the breadboard. For example, hole "C15" is where column C intersects row 15.

Multiple types of jumper wires can be used in a single project. The color of jumper wires varies to help identify the connections between different parts of the circuit, but the colors themselves do not indicate different functions. However, it is common practice to use red wires for positive power connections and black wires for negative power or ground connections.
