.. warning::
  This module **does not support Apple device** connections, so tutorials involving this module require an Android phone or tablet.

The JDY-31 Bluetooth module is a pin-compatible replacement for the HC-06 Bluetooth module. It is simpler and easier to use than the HC-06 and is often available at a slightly lower cost. 

The JDY-31 Bluetooth module is based on Bluetooth 3.0 SPP design and can support Windows, Linux, and Android data transmission. The working frequency of the JDY-31 Bluetooth module is 2.4 GHz with modulation mode GFSK. The maximum transmission power is 8 dB, and the maximum transmission distance is 30 meters. Users can modify the device name through AT command, baud rate, and other instructions.

Pins of JDY-31 and their functions:

.. list-table:: JDY-31 Pins
   :widths: 25 25 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Pin	
     - Name	
     - Description
   * - 1	
     - STATE
     - Connection status pin (not connected low level, output high level after connectio) 
   * - 2	
     - RXD	
     - Receiver pin, this pin must connect to TX pin of next device.
   * - 3	
     - TXD
     - Transmitter pin, this pin must connect to RX pin of next device.
   * - 4		
     - GND
     - GND
   * - 5	
     - VCC
     - Power Supply(1.8-3.6V, 3.3v recommended)
   * - 6	
     - EN
     - enable or disable the module. When this pin is held high, the module is enabled and begins transmitting and receiving data.

patch application: general application only need to connect VCC, GND, RXD, TXD 4 pins, if you need to actively disconnect in the connection state, send AT+DISC in the connection state.
