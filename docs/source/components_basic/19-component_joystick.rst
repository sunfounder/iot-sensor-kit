Joystick Module
==========================

Introduction
---------------------------
A joystick module is a device that can measure the movement of a knob in two directions: horizontal (X-axis) and vertical (Y-axis). A joystick module can be used to control various things such as games, robots, cameras, etc.


Principle
---------------------------
Joystick operates based on the resistance change of two potentiometers (usually 10-kilo ohms). By changing resistance in x and y directions, Arduino receives varying voltages which are interpreted to x and y coordinates. The processor needs an ADC unit to change the joystickâ€™s analog values into digital values and perform necessary processing.

Arduino boards have six 10-bits ADC channels. It means the Arduinoâ€™s reference voltage (5 volts) is divided to 1024 segments. When joystick moves along the x-axis, the ADC value rises from 0 to 1023, with the value 512 in the middle. The image below displays the ADC approximate value based on the joystick position.

Code explanation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Setting up the joystick pins. Here, we define which analog pins the X and Y axes of the joystick are connected to.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      const int xPin = A0;
      const int yPin = A1;

#. Initialization in the ``setup()`` function. This section sets up the serial communication, allowing us to send and receive messages from the Arduino through the serial monitor.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void setup() {
        Serial.begin(9600);
      }

#. Reading the joystick values in the ``loop()`` function. Continuously, the Arduino reads the X and Y values from the joystick and prints them to the serial monitor. There's a short delay after each print to make the readings more readable and to avoid overwhelming the serial monitor.

   .. code-block:: arduino
       
      void loop() {
        Serial.print("X: ");
        Serial.print(analogRead(xPin));
        Serial.print(" | Y: ");
        Serial.println(analogRead(yPin));
        delay(50);
      }

Additional Ideas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Use the joystick values to control a servo motor, making it move in response to joystick movements.
