Video 9: User-Defined Functions and Serial Input | Potentiometer to Control RGB LED
========================================================================================

This tutorial dives into the essentials of creating user-defined functions and handling serial input in Arduino programming, demonstrated through an RGB LED control project.

* **User-Defined Functions**: Learn to create custom functions for organizing and modularizing code, improving readability and reusability.
* **Serial Input**: Understand how to use the Arduino serial monitor for dynamic input, enabling real-time control of the RGB LED colors.
* **Dynamic RGB Control**: Explore methods to change RGB LED colors based on user input from the serial monitor and potentiometer readings.
* **Practical Implementation**: Apply the concepts to build a project where users can switch between manual and automatic modes for RGB color changes.
* **Challenge Activity**: Enhance the program to allow users to choose between manual mode (using potentiometers) and automatic mode (continuous color changes) for controlling the RGB LED, with an option to reset the LED state.
