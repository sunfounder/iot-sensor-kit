Video 11: Servo Motor | Single-Axis Solar Tracker using Photoresistors
========================================================================================

This tutorial dives into the essentials of controlling Servo Motors and building a single axis solar tracker using photo resistors, demonstrated through practical projects.

* **Servo Motor Basics**: Explains how Servo Motors work and how to connect and control them using PWM signals.
* **Servo Libraries**: Introduces the Servo and PWMServo libraries for controlling Servo Motors in Arduino.
* **Servo Control with Potentiometer**: Demonstrates how to control the position of a Servo Motor using a potentiometer.
* **Servo Control with Photoresistor**: Shows how to use a photoresistor to control a Servo Motor, simulating light intensity changes.
* **Single Axis Solar Tracker**: Guides through building a solar tracker using two photoresistors to position a solar panel towards the light source.
* **Challenge Activity**: Modify the program to create a single axis solar tracker using two photoresistors, simulating East and West locations.
