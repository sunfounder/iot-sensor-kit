Video 14: I2C 16x2 LCD Display ä¸¨ DHT11 - Humidity and Temperature Sensor ä¸¨ Heat Index
============================================================================================

This tutorial dives into the essentials of connecting and using a DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor and a 16x2 I2C LCD display in Arduino programming.

* **DHT11 Sensor**: Explains how to connect and read temperature, humidity, and heat index values from a DHT11 sensor. It covers the importance of using a pull-up resistor and the capability of the sensor to use either 3.3V or 5V power.
* **I2C LCD Display**: Guides through connecting and initializing a 16x2 I2C LCD display with the Arduino, highlighting how to save IO pins by using I2C communication. It includes details on adjusting the contrast and backlight of the display.
* **Library Installation**: Demonstrates how to install the necessary libraries for DHT11 and I2C LCD display from the Arduino Library Manager.
* **Coding for DHT11 and I2C LCD**: Provides a step-by-step guide on writing code to read data from the DHT11 sensor and display it on the I2C LCD. It includes checking for valid sensor readings and handling errors.
* **Displaying Data**: Shows how to display temperature, humidity, and heat index on the LCD, including how to alternate between different displays using a delay.
* **Challenge Activity**: Encourages further learning by adding a button to switch between displaying temperature and heat index in Celsius and Fahrenheit, implementing either millis() function or hardware interrupts for improved functionality.
