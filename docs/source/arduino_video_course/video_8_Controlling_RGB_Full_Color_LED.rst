Video 8: Controlling RGB Full Color LED through Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
================================================================================

This tutorial dives into the essentials of using RGB LEDs and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) in Arduino programming, demonstrated through various LED control projects.

*  **RGB LEDs**: Introduction to RGB LEDs and how they can be used to produce a wide range of colors by mixing red, green, and blue primary colors.
* **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**: Explanation of PWM and how it is used to simulate analog output by controlling the duty cycle of digital signals.
* **AnalogWrite Function**: Demonstrates using the analogWrite function to control the brightness of LEDs and mix colors through PWM.
* **LED Glowing and Fading Effects**: Guides on creating glowing and fading effects on RGB LEDs by gradually changing the duty cycle.
* **Color Mixing**: Shows how to mix different intensities of red, green, and blue to produce various colors and create a smooth color transition.
* **Automatic RGB LED Project**: Encourages building a project where the RGB LED changes colors automatically, using concepts from the tutorial.
* **Challenge Activity**: Improve the program to create an automatic color-changing RGB LED project with smooth transitions between colors.
