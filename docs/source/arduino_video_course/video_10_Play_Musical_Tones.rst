Video 10: Arrays and Piezo Buzzers | Playing Musical Tones
========================================================================================

This tutorial dives into the essentials of using arrays and generating musical tones with a piezo buzzer in Arduino programming, demonstrated through a musical tone project.

* **Piezo Buzzers**: Explains how piezo buzzers work and how different frequencies produce musical tones.
* **Tone Function**: Demonstrates the use of the ``tone`` function to generate different frequencies and produce sounds.
* **Arrays in Arduino**: Introduces arrays to organize data efficiently, simplifying the code by reducing repetitive variable declarations and hard-coded values.
* **Array and Loop Implementation**: Shows how to use arrays and loops to handle multiple musical notes and durations, making the code more scalable and easier to maintain.
* **Challenge Activity**: Provides a task to modify the program to adjust the song's tempo using a potentiometer, encouraging practical application of the concepts learned.
* **Challenge Activity**: Modify the program to allow users to adjust the song's speed using a potentiometer and create a new song of your choice.
