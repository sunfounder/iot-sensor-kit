Video 13: Hardware Interrupts | Debouncing a Button
========================================================================================

This tutorial dives into the essentials of using hardware interrupts and debouncing a button in Arduino programming, demonstrated through a traffic light and servo motor control project.

* **Hardware Interrupts**: Explains the concept of hardware interrupts, how they work, and their significance in improving program responsiveness and efficiency.
* **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**: Demonstrates how to write an ISR, which is a function that responds immediately to an external event.
* **Debouncing a Button**: Discusses the importance of debouncing to prevent multiple triggers from a single button press and how to implement it in code.
* **Volatile Keyword**: Explains the use of the volatile keyword for variables shared between the ISR and the main program to prevent compiler optimization issues.
* **Traffic Light and Servo Motor Control**: Guides through building and programming a traffic light system and controlling a servo motor, incorporating hardware interrupts and debouncing techniques.
