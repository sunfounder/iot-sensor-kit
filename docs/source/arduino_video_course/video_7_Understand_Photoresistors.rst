Video 7: Understanding Photoresistors
===========================================

This tutorial dives into the essentials of using photoresistors, nested if-else-if statements, and for loops in Arduino programming, demonstrated through a light-activated LED sequence project.

* **Introduction to Photoresistors**: Explains how photoresistors work and their application in detecting light intensity for various projects.
* **Using Photoresistors in Circuits**: Demonstrates how to integrate photoresistors in a voltage divider circuit to measure light intensity.
* **Arduino Code for Photoresistors**: Guides through setting up and using photoresistors in Arduino, including reading analog values and implementing voltage divider circuits.
* **Nested If-Else-If Statements**: Shows how to use nested if-else-if statements for multiple condition checks, particularly in adjusting the number of LEDs based on light intensity.
* **For Loops**: Introduces for loops for efficient coding, particularly in controlling multiple LEDs.
* **LED Sequence Project**: Builds a project where the LED sequence is activated based on environmental lighting, with the number of LEDs and delay adjusted according to light intensity.
* **Challenge Activity**: Encourages improving the project by incorporating an adjustable delay depending on the lighting conditions.
