Video 12: millis Function ä¸¨ Handling Multiple Tasks ä¸¨ Non-Blocking Code
========================================================================================

This tutorial dives into the essentials of implementing non-blocking code using the millis() function in Arduino programming, demonstrated through controlling a Servo motor and a traffic light operation.

* **Non-blocking Code**: Explains the importance of using millis() instead of delay() for timing events in Arduino.
* **Millis Function**: Demonstrates how the millis() function can be used to keep track of time and perform tasks without blocking code execution.
* **Servo Motor Control**: Shows how to control a Servo motor using non-blocking code to achieve smooth motion.
* **LED Blinking**: Illustrates how to make an LED blink at regular intervals without using delay().
* **Button Input**: Demonstrates how to handle button input in a non-blocking manner to trigger events.
* **Simultaneous Tasks**: Guides through managing multiple tasks simultaneously, creating an illusion of multitasking.
* **Challenge Activity**: Modify the program to create a traffic light system with a barrier controlled by a Servo motor, including an emergency button for pedestrians.
