Video 5: Digital Inputs and Conditional Logic
===============================================

Discover how to integrate digital inputs, manage floating pins with pull-up/down resistors, and apply conditional statements in Arduino Uno R4 Minima projects, exemplified with a traffic light simulation.

* **Digital Inputs**: Learning to connect push button switches as digital inputs.
* **Pull-Up/Down Resistors**: Understanding the use of resistors to stabilize floating pins in digital inputs.
* **Serial Monitor Tool**: Using the Arduino IDE's serial monitor for textual output from the Arduino board.
* **If-Else Statements**: Implementing if-else logic for decision making in Arduino sketches.
* **Traffic Light Simulation**: Demonstrating the concepts with a traffic light circuit using LEDs and push buttons.
* ``digitalRead()`` **Function**: Utilizing this function to read digital inputs and control outputs accordingly.
