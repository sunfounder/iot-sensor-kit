How to add libraries? (Important)
======================================

A library is a collection of pre-written code or functions that extend the capabilities of the Arduino IDE. Libraries provide ready-to-use code for various functionalities, allowing you to save time and effort in coding complex features.


Using the Library Manager
-------------------------------

Many libraries are available directly through the Arduino Library Manager. You can access the Library Manager by following these steps:

#. In the **Library Manager**, you can search for the desired library by name or browse through different categories.

   .. note::

      In projects where library installation is required, there will be prompts indicating which libraries to install. Follow the instructions provided, such as **"To install the library, use the Arduino Library Manager and search for “DHT sensor library” and install it."** Simply install the recommended libraries as prompted.

#. Once you find the library you want to install, click on it and then click the **Install** button.

#. The Arduino IDE will automatically download and install the library for you.

Manual Installation
-----------------------

Some libraries are not available through the **Library Manager** and need to be manually installed. To install these libraries, follow these steps:

#. Open the Arduino IDE and go to **Sketch** -> **Include Library** -> **Add .ZIP Library**.

   .. image:: img/add_lib_zip.png

#. Navigate to the directory where the library files are located and select the library file(**.zip**) and click **Open**.

#. Once the installation is complete, you will receive a notification confirming that the library has been successfully added to your Arduino IDE. The next time you need to use this library, you won't need to repeat the installation process.

#. Repeat the same process to add other libraries.


Library Location
-----------------------

The libraries installed using either of the above methods can be found in the default library directory of the Arduino IDE, which is usually located at ``C:\Users\xxx\Documents\Arduino\libraries``.

If your library directory is different, you can check it by going to **File** -> **Preferences**.
